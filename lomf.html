         <p>My girlfriend is one of the person I admire. When I first met her, I can say that the change in my life is so big. 
          She always gives me courage for every challenge of life. She opened my heart more to the Lord. 
          Whenever I feel weak, he is always there to strengthen and build me up. 
          I am very proud of my girlfriend, because she has not only been a good daughter to her mother; 
          she has also been good to my parents. My girlfriend is like falling from the sky, and I was given a woman like her.</p>

            <p>My parents are one of my most admired people in life. They were my strength whenever I was weak when I was young; 
              they gave me what I needed as a child; they developed me, so I became a person that I want to be. 
              Without them, Harwin wouldn't be here today. 
              I love my parents very much, and my admiration and love for them will never change.</p>
