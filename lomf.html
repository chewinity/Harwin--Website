         <p>My girlfriend is one of the persons I admire. 
          My life changed a lot the time I met her. 
          She helped me become closer to the Lord. 
          Whenever I feel weak, she is always there to strengthen and build me up. 
          I am very proud that she's my girlfriend, because she is not only a good daughter to her mother, but also to my parents. 
          She is like a blessing from above, because I am grateful that I have a woman like her.</p>
